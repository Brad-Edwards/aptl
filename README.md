## Demonstration of Autonomous Cyber Operations

**What happens when AI agents can conduct cyber operations autonomously?**

APTL demonstrates autonomous cyber operations through a controlled lab environment where AI agents can execute attack scenarios while human defenders practice monitoring and response using enterprise SIEM technology.

## Purpose and Scope

This lab serves two critical purposes:

### Blue Team Practice

- **Defensive Training**: Human blue team practitioners practice detecting and responding to autonomous attacks
- **SIEM Correlation**: Development of detection rules for automated attack patterns
- **Response Procedures**: Training for incident response against autonomous threat actors
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learning to distinguish automated vs. human attack behaviors

### Autonomous Cyber Weapons Awareness

- **Emerging Threat Landscape**: Demonstration of how AI agents can autonomously conduct cyber operations
- **Capability Assessment**: Understanding the current state of autonomous attack capabilities
- **Defense Implications**: Exploring what autonomous threats mean for defensive strategies
- **Policy Considerations**: Raising awareness of autonomous cyber weapons implications

## What This Lab Demonstrates

### Autonomous Attack Capabilities

- AI agents with access to penetration testing tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Autonomous vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and persistence establishment
- Real-time attack adaptation based on system responses
- Structured logging of autonomous activities for analysis

### Educational Environment

- Controlled infrastructure preventing real-world impact
- Pre-configured scenarios for consistent training
- Enterprise SIEM integration for realistic defensive practice
- Purple team exercises simulating autonomous threat scenarios

**This lab provides both practical blue team training and awareness of the evolving autonomous cyber threat landscape.**

## Technical Architecture

- IBM qRadar Community Edition SIEM for enterprise-grade log analysis
- Kali Linux red team instance with MCP-enabled AI agent access
- Victim machine with comprehensive log forwarding
- Terraform-automated AWS infrastructure deployment
