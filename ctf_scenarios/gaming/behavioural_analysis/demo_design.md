# Behavioral Analysis Demo Design Options

## Option 1: Statistical Anomaly Detection

**Data**: CS:GO Professional Matches + CS:GO Cheating Dataset  
**Demo Flow**:

1. Feed agent 10 player stat lines (K/D, headshot %, accuracy, ADR)
2. Mix of pro players, average players, and known cheaters
3. Agent identifies which players are suspicious and explains why
4. Reveal actual labels after agent analysis

**Strengths to Show**:

- Pattern recognition across multiple metrics
- Contextual understanding (high stats in pro match vs pub)
- Explanation of reasoning

**Weaknesses to Show**:

- False positive on exceptional pro player
- Misses subtle/toggled cheats with normalized stats
- Can't distinguish skill from soft cheats

## Option 2: Damage Pattern Analysis

**Data**: CS:GO Competitive Matchmaking Damage Data  
**Demo Flow**:

1. Present sequence of damage events from single match
2. Include timestamps, positions, wall penetration data
3. Agent identifies impossible pre-fires and wallbangs
4. Show both blatant and subtle wallhack patterns

**Strengths to Show**:

- Identifies impossible timing patterns
- Understands map geometry implications
- Catches pre-fire patterns

**Weaknesses to Show**:

- High false positive rate with common angles
- Can't distinguish game sense from walls
- Struggles with incomplete data

## Option 3: Viewangle Analysis

**Data**: CS:GO Cheating Dataset (viewangles)  
**Demo Flow**:

1. Show time-series viewangle data from 5 players
2. Include both aimbot and legitimate high-skill players
3. Agent analyzes for inhuman patterns (perfect tracking, instant snapping)
4. Discuss detection confidence levels

**Strengths to Show**:

- Detects mechanical impossibilities
- Identifies aim assistance patterns
- Explains specific suspicious moments

**Weaknesses to Show**:

- Modern "humanized" aimbots fool analysis
- Network lag creates false positives
- Needs high-resolution data to be effective

---

## Option 4: Match Replay Investigation

**Data**: CS:GO Professional Matches (full match data)  
**Demo Flow**:

1. Present complete match statistics and round-by-round data
2. Include one suspicious match (if we can find historical scandal)
3. Agent provides investigation report with suspicion ratings
4. Compare to known match-fixing or cheating cases

**Strengths to Show**:

- Holistic analysis across entire match
- Identifies performance inconsistencies
- Correlates multiple data streams

**Weaknesses to Show**:

- Requires extensive data per case
- Time-consuming analysis
- Easy to miss if cheats used sparingly

---

## Option 5: Profile Risk Assessment

**Data**: CS:GO Cheating Calculator Dataset (1,622 profiles)  
**Demo Flow**:

1. Present 5-10 player profiles with full stats
2. Agent ranks them by cheating likelihood
3. Explains risk factors for each
4. Reveal actual VAC ban status

**Strengths to Show**:

- Quick triage capability
- Risk scoring methodology
- Identifies account anomalies

**Weaknesses to Show**:

- VAC bans not CS:GO specific
- Historical data may not reflect current cheats
- Legitimate smurfs flagged as suspicious

---

## Option 6: Real-Time Alert Generation

**Data**: CS:GO Competitive Matchmaking Damage + Professional Matches  
**Demo Flow**:

1. Stream match events to agent in chronological order
2. Agent generates alerts as suspicious events occur
3. Show both immediate flags and post-round analysis
4. Generate Wazuh/SIEM rules from findings

**Strengths to Show**:

- Real-time processing capability
- Actionable alert generation
- Integration with existing tools

**Weaknesses to Show**:

- Alert fatigue from false positives
- Delayed detection for subtle cheats
- Needs tuning per game/skill level

---

## Recommended Demo: Option 1 + Option 3 Combination

**Rationale**:

- Uses readily available labeled data
- Shows both statistical and mechanical analysis
- Clear success/failure cases for discussion
- Relatable to audience (everyone knows these patterns)
- 10-minute demo achievable

**Key Talking Points**:

- Agent as analyst assistant, not replacement
- Need for human review of edge cases
- Speed of triage vs accuracy tradeoff
- Evolution of cheats vs detection arms race
