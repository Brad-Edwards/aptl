## What is APTL?

Docker lab with Wazuh SIEM + victim containers + Kali red team platform. AI agents can control Kali via MCP for autonomous attacks.

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This lab enables AI agents to run actual penetration testing tools. Container escape or other security issues may occur. Use only in isolated environments.**

## Components

- Wazuh SIEM (172.20.0.10-12) - Log collection and analysis
- Victim container (172.20.0.20) - Rocky Linux with SSH/HTTP/FTP
- Kali container (172.20.0.30) - Attack platform with security tools
- MCP server - Enables AI agent control of Kali tools

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Brad-Edwards/aptl.git
cd aptl
./start-lab.sh
```

**Access:**
- Wazuh Dashboard: <https://localhost:443> (admin/SecretPassword)  
- Victim SSH: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/aptl_lab_key labadmin@localhost -p 2022`
- Kali SSH: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/aptl_lab_key kali@localhost -p 2023`

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose
- 8GB+ RAM, 20GB+ disk
- Linux/macOS/WSL2
- Ports available: 443, 2022, 2023, 9200, 55000

## AI Integration (MCP)

Build MCP server for AI agent control:

```bash
cd mcp && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

Configure your AI client to connect to `./mcp/dist/index.js`

Test: Ask your AI agent "Use kali_info to show me the lab network"
